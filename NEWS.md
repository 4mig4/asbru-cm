Dear testers,

we have recently merged the codebase for version 6.1.0 into master. This release will bring some cleanups and a few new features which requires testing.

These new features are:

* Support for SOCKS Proxy (VNC/RDP) using netcat
* SSH tunnels

We would be happy if you can test the master snapshots as we would like to release the first official rc1 build soon.

Thanks and happy testing.
